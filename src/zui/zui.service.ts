/**
 * To understand the following you need to understand the concept of the
 * svg's panning and zooming.
 *
 * The component distinguishes between the svg- and the browser-space. These
 * spaces can be be mapped bidirectional to each other. Svg-space uses the
 * coordinate system established by the svg (e.g. <rect x="100" y="100" ... >
 * creates a rectangle at 100/100 - this does *not* mean, that the rectangle,
 * will be displayed at 100/100 to the user). The user sees everything from the
 * svg-space projected to the browser-space.
 *
 * It's very important to note, that when the user navigates through the svg,
 * the svg's viewport is *not* moving. Rather, the user moves the elements in
 * the svg.
 *
 * Let p_svg be a point in svg_space and p_browser a point in browser-space.
 * Further, let z be the (numeric) zoomlevel (e.g. 2 indicating a zoom of 200%)
 * and t be the translate-vector (e.g -150/-100 indicating a shift of 150 to the right
 * and 100 down):
 *
 * p_browser = p_svg * z - t
 *
 * If the user zoomes to 200% (z = 2) and moves the graphic by 100/100 (translate =
 * [-140,-150]), a point at 100/100 will be displayed at 340/350:
 *
 * [100,100] * 2 - [-140,-150] = [340,350]

	 * Calculates the new translate after zooming
	 *
	 * The zooming works like the zooming in Google Maps. If you want to zoom into a
	 * city, you place your cursor above it and zoom in (e.g. by using the mouse-wheel).
	 * To generalise, if you place your cursor above a point, you want your mouse
	 * to stay during zooming.
	 *
	 * Because the cursor-position is provided in the browser-space, we need to map
	 * it into the svg space (see explanation above):
	 *
	 *     p_browser = p_svg * z - t
	 * <=> p_svg = (p_browser - t) / z
	 *
	 * let c be the cursor-position when zooming, t_o the current translate, z_o the former
	 * zoomlevel, z_n the new zoomlevel.
	 *
	 *     (c - t_o) / z_o = (c - t_n) / z_n
	 * <=> ((c - t_o) / z_o) * z_n = c - t_n
	 * <=> t_n = c - ((c - t_o) / z_o) * z_n     // f = z_n / z_o
	 * <=> t_n = c - f * (c - t_o)
	 *
	 *     t_n = f(c, z_o, z_n, t_o) = zoom(c, z_o, z_n, t_o);
